##### Made for the competition "CaSScade" #####

This website is created for the 3rd round of "CaSScade" competition, in which the theme of the website was given as "Clean Energy".
Based on this theme an informative website was created by me, in which the basic information about different types of renewable energy is given.
The name of the website is "ENERGY EDUCATION".
This website is Laptop / Desktop only.
So, please view this website on laptop / desktop only. Please view it on 100% scale.
